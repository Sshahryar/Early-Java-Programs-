First-ever Java programs I made from 2022-2023.

Salvaged, fixed, and revamped programs from old high school class taken in 2022-2023, personal info and classmate collaborations were removed.

## 1. bingocard.java

### Description: bingocard.java was my first ever java program, it is a simple application that prints out a simple bingo ruleset such as that in a bingo card:

1. The caller randomly pulls a numbered bingo hall.
2. The number is placed on the bingo board and called out.
3. Players look for for the called number on their bingo card.
4. If the number is located, it is marked off.
5. Steps 1 to 4 are repeated until a player matched the BINGO pattern.
6. The winning player yells BINGO.

### Source Code:

public class bingocard {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     
        System.out.println("Bingo Rules\n");
        System.out.println("1. The caller randomly pulls a numbered bingo hall.\n");
        System.out.println("2. The number is placed on the bingo board and called out.\n");
        System.out.println("3. Players look for for the called number on their bingo card.\n");
        System.out.println("4. If the number is located, it is marked off.\n");
        System.out.println("5. Steps 1 to 4 are repeated until a player matched the BINGO pattern.\n"); 
        System.out.println("6. The winning player yells BINGO.\n");

    } 

### Output:
